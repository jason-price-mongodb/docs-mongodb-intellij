Definition
----------

The {+intellij-full+} examines application queries for index use. If a
query doesn't use an index, the plugin shows a warning.

To resolve the warning, create an index for the query. You can disable
the warning.

Before adding an index, consider:

- Does the query run often enough that you are willing to reduce the
  write speed for faster reads?
- Is there a way to write the query to use existing indexes? 

Example
-------

In the following example Java code snippet, the ``dispute.status`` field
is used in a query, but there is no index on the field:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   public List<Document> findAllPending DisputesByTypeFare() {
      return trips.find( Filters.and(
         Filters.eq( fieldName: "dispute.status", value: "pending" ),
         Filters.eq( fieldName: "dispute.type", value: "fare" )
      )).into( new ArrayList<> () );
   }

The plugin shows a missing index warning:

``This query will run without an index. If you plan on using this query
heavily in your application, you should create an index that covers this
query.``

The warning has a *quick action* link that you can click to create an
index for the query.

Create an Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an index for the query, click the *Implement an Index* quick
action in the warning. The plugin displays initial code to create an
index that you can modify.

The code comments show recommended fields to index, which you can copy
and paste into the template directly and run the code to create the
indexes.

Disable Warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable the index warning in the plugin, go to Settings > search for
Inspections > MongoDB > uncheck Query does not use an index.
