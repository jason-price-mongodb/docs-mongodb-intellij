The {+intellij-full+} examines the document fields in queries to ensure
the data types are valid. For example, if you use a document field in an
equality comparison, or an insert or update operation, the
plugin examines the field to ensure the type is valid.

If the type is invalid, the plugin shows a warning that indicates
the type cannot be assigned.

To resolve the warning, change the field value to match the expected
type. If the field is dynamically typed and strict typing rules aren't
applied, you can ignore the invalid type warning.



The plugin analyzes queries in your application to see if the query hits
an index or not. If it does not hit an index, the plugin will display a
warning similar to this:


To resolve this warning, you must first decide if you want to create an
index for the query. Some factors to consider before indexing: Does the
query run often enough that you are willing to compromise write speed
for a faster read speed? Is there another way you can write the query to
use existing indexes? 

Note: support for Aggregation in the roadmap, feel free to comment on
this ticket to express your interest to have Aggregations supported.
Creating an Index Once you have decided you want to create an index for
the query, you can click on “Implement an Index” quick action that’s
shown as part of the warning. It will take you to the Database Explorer
Playgrounds with a template code to create an index. In the first line
of comments you’ll see recommended fields to index, which you can copy
and paste into the template directly and run the Playground to create
the indexes.

Disable the warning If you want to disable this warning, we
currently do not have a way to turn the switch off. The best way to
achieve this currently is to go to Settings > search for Inspections >
MongoDB > uncheck Query does not use an index
