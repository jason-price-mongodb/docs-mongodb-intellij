Definition
----------

The {+intellij-full+} examines application queries for index use. If a
query doesn't use an index, the plugin displays a warning.

To resolve the warning, create an index for the query. You can also
disable the warning.

Before you add an index, consider:

- Does the query run often enough to justify reducing the write speed
  for faster reads?
- Can you change the query to use existing indexes? 

For more information on indexes, see :ref:`manual-create-an-index`.

Example
-------

In the following example Java code snippet, the ``awards.text`` document
field is used in a query, but there is no index on the field:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   client.getDatabase("sample_database").getCollection("movies").find(
      Filters.ne("awards.text", "Comedy")
   )

The plugin shows a missing index warning:

``This query will run without an index. If you plan on using this query
heavily in your application, you should create an index that covers this
query.``

The warning has a *quick action* link that you can click to create an
index for the query.

Create Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an index for the query, click the *Implement an Index* quick
action in the warning. The plugin displays initial code to create an
index that you can modify. The code shows recommended fields to
index.

For example:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false


Disable Index Warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable the index warning in the plugin, go to Settings > search for
Inspections > MongoDB > uncheck Query does not use an index.
