Definition
----------

The MongoDB IntelliJ plugin examines document fields to ensure the data
types are valid. For example, when you use a document field that
performs an operation like an equality comparison, an insert or update
of document values, and so on, the field type is examined to ensure it
is valid.

If the document field doesn't match the required type, the plugin shows
a warning that indicates the type doesn't match.

Examples
--------

In the following example Java code snippet, the ``trip_status`` field
type is ``String`` but the query ``Filters`` operation performs equality
comparison on the ``integer`` value ``1324324``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   public List<Document> findCompleted TripsByDriver( String driverId ) {
      return trips.find( Filters.and(
         Filters.eq( fieldName: "trip_status", value: 1324324 )
         Filters.eq( fieldName: "driver_id", driverId )
      )).into( new ArrayList<> () );
   }

Because the types don't match, the plugin shows a notification about the
invalid types:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false
   
   "Integer" (type of provided value) can not be assigned to
   "String" (type of "trip_status")

To resolve the type issue, you can change the value to match the
required ``String`` field type. Alternatively, if the field is
dynamically typed and strict typing rules aren't applied, you can ignore
the type issue.
