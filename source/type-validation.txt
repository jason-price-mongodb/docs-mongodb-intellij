The plugin examines your document fields to ensure the data type is
correct. For example, when you enter a document field for code that
performs an equality comparison, inserting or updating a document value,
and so on, the field is examined to ensure it is correct.

If your document field doesn't match the required type, the plugin shows
a warning that indicates the type doesn't match.

In the following example code snippet, the field type for
``trip_status`` is a string but the query predicate performs equality
comparison on an integer value. Because the types don't match, the
plugin shows a warning about the mismatched types.

.. code-block:: java

   public List<document> findCompleteTripsByDriver(String driverID) {
      return trips.find( Filters.and(
         Filters.eq( fieldName: "dispute.status", value: "pending" ),
         ...
      )
      ...
   }gggggggg
   

To resolve the warning, you can change the value to match the required
field type. Alternatively, if the field is dynamically typed and strict
typing rules aren't applied, you can ignore the warning.
