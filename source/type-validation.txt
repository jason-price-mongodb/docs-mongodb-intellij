The plugin examines your document fields to ensure the data type is
correct. For example, when you enter a document field for code that
performs an equality comparison, inserting or updating a document value,
and so on, the field is examined to ensure it is correct.

If your document field doesn't match the required type, the plugin shows
a warning that indicates the type doesn't match.

In the following example the field type for ``trip_status`` is a string
but the query predicate performs equality comparison on an integer.
Because the types don't match, therefore the plugin shows a warning
about the type mismatch.

To resolve this issue, ensure you change the value to match the expected
field type. Alternatively, if the field is dynamically typed (i.e. no
strict typing rules need to be applied), then you can safely ignore the
warning.
