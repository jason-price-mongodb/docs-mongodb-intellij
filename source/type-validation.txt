When your document field type mismatches in cases such as checking
equality, inserting or updating values, and more, the plugin will display
an in-line warning letting you know about the type mismatch. 

Note: support for Aggregation in the roadmap, feel free to comment on
this ticket to express your interest to have Aggregations supported.

In the following example the field type for ``trip_status`` is a string but
the query predicate is doing an equality check on an integer, therefore
the plugin is warning you of the mismatched type.

To resolve this issue, ensure you change the value to match the expected
field type. Alternatively, if the field is dynamically typed (i.e. no
strict typing rules need to be applied), then you can safely ignore the
warning.
